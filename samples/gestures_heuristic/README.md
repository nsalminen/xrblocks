# Heuristic Gesture HUD

This sample enables the heuristic gesture recognizer and shows a simple HUD that
displays the most confident gesture per hand while logging gesture start/end
events to the console. Use it to validate pinch, open-palm, fist, thumbs-up,
point, and spread detections in the simulator or on device.

Follow the [development guide](../../README.md#development-guide) to serve the
repository, then open `http://localhost:8080/samples/gestures_heuristic/` in a
WebXR-capable browser.
